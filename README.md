Hey, 

I'm Jackie, a high schooler passionate about computer science and applied mathematics. I'm very new to these topics, but I hope to explore these two vast, immense worlds and gain a deeper understanding!

Outside of these subjects, I love to run (I'm on my school's cross country and track team), bike (I love exploring the sights around me), cook (I love exploring new cuisines!), and help others!

Feel free to message me on Discord: Swift#6900

Have an amazing day!
