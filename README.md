Hey! 

I'm Jackie, an incoming computer science major at Stanford University. I'm passionate about web/app design, AI/ML, and embedded systems. I'm proficient in Java, C++, and PyTorch, and familiar with CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and TensorFlow.

Outside of computing, I love to explore nature, cook new foods, engineer gadgets, and play with my cat, Artemis!

Feel free to message me on Discord: swift.cpp

Have an amazing day!
