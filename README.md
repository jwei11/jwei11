Hey! 

I'm Jackie, a high school junior passionate about web/app design, AI/ML, and competitive programming. I'm proficient in C++ and familiar with CSS/HTML/Java.

Outside of computing, I love to run, cycle, cook, and help others!

Feel free to message me on Discord: swift.cpp

Have an amazing day!
